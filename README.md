## How to run webterm server
DEBUG MODE: (not using docker)
```
cd webterm_server/
./run.sh        # will ask for sudo authority
```

DOCKER MODE: (only if docker is implemented)
```

# go to app.js in webterm_server/node-webterm/ and modify variable "debug" to false

cd webterm_server/
./run.sh        # will ask for sudo authority
```
